- 😄 Pronouns: chocolate
- ⚡ Fun fact: Dark chocolate > 64% vs Coffee energy comparison
def energy_comparison(chocolate, coffee):
    if chocolate > coffee:
        return "Dark chocolate (>64%) is more energizing than coffee!"
    else:
        return "Coffee is more energizing than dark chocolate."

# Dark Chocolate vs Coffee Energy Levels
dark_chocolate = 100  # energy value of dark chocolate (>64%)
coffee = 95  # assumed energy value of coffee

result = energy_comparison(dark_chocolate, coffee)
print(result)
